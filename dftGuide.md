# A Guide to Density Functional Theory Calculations  
Written by Nathan Paisley

## The Purpose of This Guide
This guide is intended to teach you how to run DFT calculations. My experience is with using DFT for optimizing structures, ensuring the lowest energy conformation has been found, and getting excited state data and that is what is covered in this guide. For background theory on DFT and computational chemistry (I would recommend the book *Introduction to Computational chemistry* by Frank Jensen) or information on running other types of calculations you will have to do further reading. 

## Getting Started
### Required Programs
Running DFT calculations wil require you to model compounds of interest, make plain text input files, move files to and from remote servers, access remote servers from the command line, and analyze calculation data. The programs you will use to do this differ depending on the operating system you are using but I will give suggestions below (based on experience running DFT on each the three major operating systems).  
#### Windows
##### Molecular modelling:  
##### Text editor:  
##### sftp client:  
##### ssh client:  
##### result analysis:  

#### MacOS
